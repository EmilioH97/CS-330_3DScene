1.	How do I approach designing software?

I like to start with a written plan of steps that I will take to achieve my desired results. 

o	What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

I think this taught me more about how learning new skills would come together to achieve my final project. 

o	What design process did you follow for your project work?

I took what I learned each week and used that as a guide to create the scene I established early in the term. 

o	How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

This would help me to better plan my steps to achieve my goals while creating a visual guide to follow. 

3.	How do I approach developing programs?

I like to break the process in smaller tasks that can be built upon to achieve the program. 

o	What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

This was very new to me so I think I needed to make sure I really understood each aspect of 3D modeling before moving forward. 

o	How did iteration factor into your development?

Every week I needed to take what I learning and use it again in my main project to create my scene. 

o	How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

I was able to create much larger and detailed code that worked across multiple files which was a huge step forward for myself. 

4.	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

This has been teaching me the skills I need to reach my goal of becoming a video game developer. 

o	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

This has given me the skills to create a 3D environment that can be expanded into a video game. 
o	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

This has been the start to a much more expansive 3D world I hope to eventually build in a video game.
